This is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). It was forked from [broccolini/Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/Swiss). A lot of the original code has been deleted and I have developed the theme to my liking, but the original is great on its own if you're looking for a Jekyll theme.

To see what the front matter should look like in posts, check out examples from [KyleRego/KyleRego.github.io](https://github.com/KyleRego/KyleRego.github.io).
